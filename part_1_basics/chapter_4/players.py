	# Same like when defining an item, we used "slice"
	# this defines a group of items from the list
	# when range is (,) slice uses [:]
	# as in range the frs tindex is where the range starts
	# the last marks the border, so the slice prints -1 from it
	# because list counts from 0, do nt forget off-by-one rule
print(players[1:4])
	# prints a slice with indexes 1,2,3
	
print(players[:2])
	# Pythond utomatically starts at the begnning of the list

print(players[2:])
	# similar syntax - Python slices from "2" till the end
