# EXCERCISE:
# Write a series od conditional tests
# print a statement describing each test and your precondition for the result
# Look closely at the results
# make sure you understand why each line evaluates True or False
# Create 10 such tests. 5 True and 5 False

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'?  I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')
# important detail - the print has no quotation but uses == as a\
# variable comparison - so the print will be True or False

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
