# while loop, runs through a condition as long as the statement is true

while current_number <= 5:

# in first line we start counting from 1
# the while loop is set to run as long sas the number <= 5
# the code inside the while loop prints the current number and then
# (+=) adds 1, making the current_number value = 2
# compraes it with the while parameters and repeats until
# the while statement is not true
